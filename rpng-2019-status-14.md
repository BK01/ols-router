Sprint: 6

## Overview

We are about half way through Sprint 6 and would be willing to participate in a mid-sprint meeting if necessary.
Recently we have made minor enhancements to the turn restriction editor tool (including #112, #132) and updated its various data inputs. This includes refreshing the road network based on the most recent ITN data.
Also, we identified and loaded intersection candidates for editor review. These consist of highways that pass through the MVRD and truck routes on the major road network in the lower mainland. Several hours of testing and validation has occurred (#136), and the operational process is quite efficient.
Two bugs have been fixed: between pairs optimized route (#137) and overpass turn restrictions (#138). These have not yet been deployed to our development environment.
