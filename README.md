# ols-router
BC Route Planner NG is a three year project of the Province of British Columbia to develop a state-of-the art route planner. 

In year 1 (2018-19), the BC Route Planner NG will support time-dependent routing including historic traffic congestion, road incidents and closures, road construction, and ferry schedules. In year 2, support for truck routing will be added. Truck routing takes vehicle dimensions and road restrictions into account. Year 3 will be focussed on performance engineering and incorporating new data sources.
