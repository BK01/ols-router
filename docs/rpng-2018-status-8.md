# RouterNG, Status Report #8
Date: 2018-10-26<br>
Sprint: 4<br>
Prepared by: Graeme Leeming, *Refractions Research Inc.*<br>

Late last week Chris completed some log and error handling enhancements. This has simplified the turn restriction inputs and cleaned up the log so that any significant issues can more easily be identified.
All features planned for sprint 3 had been completed before our team meeting last week. These were described and demonstrated, providing a completed framework suitable for DataBC to demo to MOTI and others.
The following plan for sprint 4 was sketched out:
• Add new functionality for supporting scheduling (ferries)
• Enhance event handling to consider the effects of delaying the route at a shutdown until the next opening
• Convert the FME prep scripts that generate turn restrictions into equivalent Java routines suitable for the router pre-processing application.
Recently we have had low availability, so apart from some testing, very little progress has been made towards sprint 4 goals. Periods of limited activity were anticipated; this was brought up at the team meeting. As a result, the fourth sprint was planned to take this into account, and so the development goals for this upcoming stretch of work are not as ambitious, and the timeframe to complete will be longer (six weeks or more).
