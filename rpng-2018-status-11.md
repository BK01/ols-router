Sprint: 5<br>
Prepared by: Graeme Leeming, *Refractions Research Inc.*
# Overview
Sprint 5 is now underway. With Leo on holidays, further progress on government deployment preparations will have to wait until the new year. In the meantime, Chris has completed and locally deployed fixes/enhancements related to two minor tickets:
* [Add ferry terminal name to rollover text and balloon text of icons in ferries layer](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-router/issues/107)
* [Change layer name from Ferry schedules to Ferry terminals](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-router/issues/107)

A small amount of testing has also been performed. As discussed in our last team meeting, low resource availability will continue into the new year.
