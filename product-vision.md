## BC Route Planner
Road and ferry travel are essential to conducting business and serving the citizens of the Province of British Columbia. Route planning can be used to find the best routes, determine proximity of clients to service delivery locations, and optimize goods and service delivery.  Route planning is useful in many government business activities, from field operations to resource and emergency planning, policy-making, and law-making.

The BC Route Planner is a common component that can be used in all government digital services. BC Route Planner uses the BC Integrated Transportation Network which is the authoritative source of road network data for the Province. The Route Planner is registered with the BC Data Catalogue, uses the DataBC API Gateway, and supports industry standards in its design and specification including REST and OpenAPI 3.0. This makes it easy for developers to use our services in their digital services.

All source code for the BC Route Planner is available on github and released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. The BC Route Planner leverages other open source projects such as JSprit and Apache Spring.
