|Issue Id| Issue                        | Implications                 | Recommendation
|---|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1|Some access restrictions are represented as road names instead of access restriction codes|Best routes will include road that a given vehicle type is not allowed on|Add appropriate access restrictions|
|2|One-ways not consistently used for turn lanes and ramps|Without a one-way, extra turn-restrictions are required|Make data consistent
|3|All 22,000 intersections on the backbone and ribs of the highway and Greater Vancouver road networks need their turn-restrictions validated and corrected if necessary|Best routes will contain illegal turns| Validate and fix turn-restrictions|
|4|Many yield lanes are missing|Best route duration will be a bit higher because yield lanes have lower turn cost than stop lanes|Add yield lanes|
|5|Many divided road intersections are missing connector segments|Missing segments will prevent from including valid turns which will make routes longer than necessary|Add missing connector segments
