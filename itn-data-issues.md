|Issue Id| Issue                        | Implications                 | Recommendation
|---|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1|Road access restrictions not consistently populated|Sometimes access restriction appears as road name|Vehicles will be routed on roads they aren't allowed on|Add appropriate access restrictions|
|2|One-ways not consistently used for turn lanes and ramps|Without a one-way, extra turn-restrictions are required|Make data consistent
|3|All 22,000 intersections on the highway and Greater Vancouver road network backbones and ribs need their turn-restrictions validated and corrected if necessary|
